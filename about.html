                Liangxiao Zhang is a Chinese photographer, who is working in Safavieh, a furnishing company. 
He majored biological science in Fudan University, but he started to be interested in photography at that time. When graduating from Fudan in 2012, he found a job in China Mobile, the biggest telecommunication company in China. He still takes time and effort on photography as a hobby. 
Three years later, he left the telecommunication company and decided to start his career as a photographer. He participated a half-year training for commercial photographers in Beijing Film Academy in 2015. Then, in the next year, he applied to Pratt Institute, an art institute in New York, to have a further study on photography. He got the offer after a few months and graduated in 2018, after two years' study.
After graduation from Pratt, he continues his career as a furnishing photographer in Safavieh until now. He likes photography, not as an creative platform to present the strong personal or political attitude, but as a magnifying glass to read his life.   
    Liangxiao's street photos are good represents of his thought on photography. He also knows to keep a balance between attitude and commercial in his portraits and furnishing photos. He is open to different ideas on photography and he would like to try every of them if he gets a chance.
