                I use photos as a record of my memory in this project. Both memory and photo are fragments of time and space. They break up the whole story into pieces, and pick up some highlights or just details to present it. From these two media for recording, I can neither get a whole picture at any moment nor save a scene from the start to the end. However, their limit is the key of this project.<br> 
I photograph the interesting moments or things I met in my daily life in this project, and place them in order. Like my memory, the photos only present the selected moments. Their relationship in time, space or logic are hidden behind the gap between each two photos. Also, a visual and emotional relationship is building up when your eyes jump among these pictures back and forth. The new relationship varies to every viewer since their emotion and thought are widely different. One story then becomes to a hundred, a thousand or more stories. These photos present nothing, but a help for the viewers to build their own stories.
